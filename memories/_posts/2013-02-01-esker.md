For me, Professor Slocum represented everything, in every way, that a college literature professor should be and, in her case, simply was. From her love of Chaucer and Flannery O'Connor, to her rare wit, to her insistence that we read our assigned passages aloud to the class (Beowulf and the Canterbury Tales included, in the original text), she was a rare person indeed. She once formed a personal concern that I was taking just too many courses one semester, pulled me into her office for a meeting and, satisfying herself that I could manage, turned me loose even more confident. She also developed a warm friendship with my mother, herself a former UA instructor and the campus kindergarten lab teacher, through Professor Slocum's own children who were young students in that campus center, and my mother shares her sympathies and prayers at Sally's passing. On behalf of my mother and myself and the Esker family, our prayers and thoughts go out to Professor Slocum's family. I'd like to think, for now, Chaucer himself described something that Sally Slocum truly was:
  
That well by reason men it call may  
The daisie, or els the eye of the day,  
The emprise, and floure of floures all.
