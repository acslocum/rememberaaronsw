sally taught me that people who talk slowly can be smart. through her i began to see the power of carefully crafted language. she was able to condense minutes of my furious rants into single all-encapsulating pithy phrases. occasionally, she employed a conversational device where, by design, she would skip two thoughts ahead of you and quip. later, she'd gracefully offer you a well placed pause to catch up. sally was a conversational jujitsu master â€” just the right amount of force applied in just the right place and you, interlocutor, skidded to a stop on your back half way across the room. and all while speaking so beautifully. she sounded like she was reading verse as she was telling you what she was making for dinner. she spoke like she was always comfortably seated in a recliner, puffing a cigarette and sipping a drink while the follow-spot was locked on her. ensnaring you in that slow, smart cadence.
