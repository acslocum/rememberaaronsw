I only hope I can carry myself with the same grace, dignity, and love for my subjects in the classroom that Sally did. Through it all, she was always proud of her students. Some time well into my career in Medieval literature, I ran into Sally, and without a hello, she said, "It's my fault, isn't it?" I simply said, "Yes, it is." Typical Sally: aware of her impact, proud of her former student, but with a touch of self-deprecation so it never came across as boastful, even though I always knew how proud she was of me and all of her former students.
