Sally's selection that she read at our wedding was so beautifully spoken
in her cadence that we could visualize the changing of seasons
of the brook  and apply it to the cycle of life; how our commitment
no matter how we or our lives change,  for better or worse, in all forms,
we are part of this natural cycle & will always love each other for what
we have been for each other in the past, present and future.

_Hyla Brook_  
By June our brook's run out of song and speed.  
Sought for much after that, it will be found  
Either to have gone groping underground  
(And take with it all the Hyla breed  
That shouted in the mist a month ago,  
Like ghost of sleigh bells in a ghost of snow)-  
Or flourished and come up in jewelweed,  
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent  
Even against the way its waters went.  
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet  
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat-  
A brook to non but who remember long.  
This as it will be seen is other far  
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song,  
We love the things we love for what they are.
