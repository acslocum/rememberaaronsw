I am so sad today because I just heard about Sally's passing. I will miss my dear friend and partner at MS World. Wednesdays were always special because Sally enjoyed talking with everyone so much and she was so inspirational and gave us all strength with her positive attitude and her humor. You will be sorely missed my friend.
