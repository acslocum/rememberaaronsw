In 1971, having just become an English major, I told my father about my inspiring English professor, Dr. Slocum. He chuckled and said, “Uh-oh.”
In the mid-‘60s, Dad was the head of ROTC at Akron U. One day a young professor came to his office to complain about what had just happened to her. It seems that Sally had been walking on campus when a formation of cadets came marching along taking up the whole sidewalk. Everyone stepped aside to let them pass. Well, almost everyone.  
Dr. Slocum asked Lt. Col. Harby why in the world the ROTC cadets thought they had the right to hog a campus sidewalk, expecting everyone else to get out of the way.  
My dad, a combat veteran who preferred to avoid conflict when possible, knew a worthy adversary when he saw one, and so he was happy to note Sally’s beautiful Southern accent. They soon discovered that they were both from South Carolina. Thus began a grudging mutual admiration. Imagine their mutual glee when I suddenly planted myself between them.  
As I continued in my studies, taking several courses from Sally and becoming friends, my dad always asked after her, and she him. Even the last time I saw Sally several years ago, one of her first questions was, “So how’s the Colonel?” When I told him that, he chuckled again. 
Now they’re both gone. But not really. Not ever.
