Sally Slocum was a wonderful professor beloved by all her students. I regret that I didn't end up getting to take one of her classes. What I remember is having to withdraw from her Chaucer class because there were too many students enrolled--the university had capped it at 40! which is way too big for that kind of class. So I gave her a break and switched classes. Recently I worked with Sally on the Obama campaign making phone calls. It was great to have her and she made a real contribution to getting President Obama elected. I'm glad she lived to see him win. Thanks Sally.
