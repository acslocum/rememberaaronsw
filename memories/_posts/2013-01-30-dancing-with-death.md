*RIP Sally Kennedy Slocum. January 28, 2013. This is for Tom.*

*Dancing with Death - a poem by Shades of Pale*

My hurt burns to ashes  
Blowing away with the cold winter night  
leaving me empty and hallow  
a hole placed deep within my chest  
My body turns cold and lifeless  
Stiff, broken and bruised  
My eyes glass over  
Fear was the last I saw reaping back  
and I, finally finally found peace  
Dancing with death  
With broken records clashing  
And I'll keep dancing  
Death will keep the rhythm  
We will tap our toes together  
Twirl around in circles  
With death  
The one we feared the most  
Can dance the tango  
And the tango, we will dance  

*Thomas A Slocum, Andy Slocum and the rest of the family, you are in our thoughts and our hearts.*
