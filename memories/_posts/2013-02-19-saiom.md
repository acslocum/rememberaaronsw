Her heart's meadows and woods  
are  
  
wild rose sprinkled  
milkweed sparkled  
pansy pinked and  
larkspur sprayed  
 
crocus laced  
clover jeweled  
daffodil dotted and  
sunflower rayed  
  
samara starred  
spirea spangled,  
daisy dusted and  
violet spattered  
  
buttercup strewn  
trillium studded,  
bluebell splashed and  
dandelion splattered  
  
poppy peppered  
cowslip stippled  
phlox flagged and  
snowdrop speckled  
  
mayapple dappled  
chicory flecked  
aster asterisked and  
tigerlily freckled
