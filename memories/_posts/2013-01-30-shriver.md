Sally fought courageously for many years against the pernicious illness. She would not let it keep her from being active in seeing her grandson or working in progressive politics. She gave me the willingness to try again with Chaucer as she did with thousands of her students. Tom's enduring loving support inspired everyone who witnessed it. Please sprinkle some miracle'd angeldust on Akron, Sally.
