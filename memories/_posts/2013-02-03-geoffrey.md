Sally Kennedy Slocum changed my life. She inspired me to go to graduate school, which is something I would never have conceived of, prior to being in her poetry class. She even inspired me and another student to go to her own grad school, University of Tennessee. I took several other classes from her, including Chaucer, of course. Never reacting, ever "dry" in tone, but always supportive, I'll miss her annual Christmas cards and other communications. God bless you Sally! I would love be a fly on the wall when you sit down finally with your beloved Geoffrey.
