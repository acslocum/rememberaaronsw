1968\. Akron.  
Blue collar, union, racist, sexist, hard.  
Lost boys, sons of sons of rubber rats.  
First generation scholars at the local State Univ.  
All of us steeled by years of corporal punishment,  
verbal abuse, running the streets and our cars,  
and trying to be tough enough.  
Riots. War. Draft. Civil rights. Drugs. Music. Sex.  
Freed from our moral and physical cages - living together like brothers.  
College?  
  
Whooshhhh! In she comes from "down South."  
Erudite. Beautiful. Demanding.  
Out Spoken. Soft Spoken.  
Steadfast. Open. Hopeful.  
The whole bundle of apparent contradictions  
most of us had never seen.  
She showed all of us what women could be.  
The feminist who never forgot her femininity.  
She opened our hardened hearts by her example  
and taught us respect for others and for ourselves.  
And as I know she wished, through her love of poesy,  
she gave us the lifelong gifts of exploration  
and connection with those who tried before.  
  
She was the "sweete breeth" of fresh air that touched us.
