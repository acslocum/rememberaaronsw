Words seem inadequate to express the sadness I feel for the loss of Sally. She was a loving, caring person and offered support to hundreds of people going through the difficulties of multiple sclerosis. I met Sally almost 5 years ago at MsWorld and will always remember how she encouraged me to have a positive attitude. I will miss her terribly. Please accept my most heartfelt sympathy for your loss. My thoughts are with you and your family during this difficult time.
