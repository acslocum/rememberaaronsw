I am a foodie, in part, from the influence of one Sally Pitts Kennedy
Slocum. As a kid, we lived on pretty standard Betty Crocker-like food.
Chef-Boy-R-Dee make-it-yourself pizza kit was fun for a Friday night when
the parents were out. So, Craig Claiborne and the South Carolina Low Country
were welcome influences. Hands down, Sally made THE BEST scrambled eggs ever
ever ever. My husband, Tim, says it must have been butter. I don't know, but
I can still see her stirring those eggs over a low flame in her Le Creuset
frying pan. The eggs were often accompanied by sauteed chicken livers and
french Pommery mustard from a crock. Not only was the mustard delicious, but
the crock also made a nice pencil holder.
