This site is a place to share memories about Sally Kennedy Slocum, PhD

This site is based on [http://rememberaaronsw.com](http://rememberaaronsw.com), a site dedicated to [Aaron Swartz](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) which was created according to the following principles:

* uses free and open source software wherever possible
* licenses its content under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
* is open to the technical community to hack on and contribute to
* leverages tools that Aaron used and contributed to, like Markdown and RSS


If you'd like to contribute, please [fork the repo on Github](https://github.com/acslocum/rememberaaronsw)
and get hacking. Alternatively, you can [email your memories](mailto:slocum+sally@gmail.com) to share
them directly with Sally's family and friends, who will work to shift them onto the website as quickly as possible.

### Technical Details

All content on this site is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), to which Aaron was a noted contributor.
It's rendered to static HTML using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), served using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
and the content is, of course, syndicated using [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS).
